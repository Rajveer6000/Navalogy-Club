IoMT devices use their environment to detect, collect and send vital information about the medical parameters of a user/patient. This data can be then used for health monitoring of patients remotely and predicting their health conditions. Now, in order to transmit this huge amount of data and information IoT devices need to adopt certain machine-to-machine (M2M) communication protocols. In IoMT, it is very much crucial to choose the right protocol for the communication of critical data. In this paper, we are evaluating the performances of the four most widely used M2M protocols such as - Message Queuing Telemetry Transport Protocol (MQTT), Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), and Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), in terms of packet size and Round Trip Time (RTT) which are two essential factors in terms of transmission of medical data. Performances of these protocols are tested in an IoMT kit developed using several medical as well as general purpose sensors. We also compare the protocols based on their security and QoS features for their suitability to IoMT. Based on the experimental results and feature comparisons, MQTT proves to be the most suitable M2M protocol for IoMT.

Although each pair has their own lights and shadows, given the contemporary scenario, fog computing models seem to gain the most relevance among others. The pivot of the work presented in this paper is the optimization of fog task scheduling through an improved Resource Utilisation Algorithm (iRASA), which uses the congregation of Multiverse Optimisation (MVO) and Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO), in achieving the aforementioned objective. The suggested algorithm has been contrasted with individual performances of PSO and MVO in task scheduling along with that of a generic scheduler in cases of fixed as well as variable numbers of VMs. The results obtained show that the suggested approach surpasses its counterparts in minimizing makespan and simultaneously enhancing throughput as well as resource utilization.

This system can increase the medical staff efficiency by drastically decreasing their duties in hospitals and the need to attend to them individually. Patients in their home isolation may utilize the device as well, and their vital indicators may be checked by doctors remotely.

In recent times where people around the globe are suffering from the Covid-19 pandemic, providing remote healthcare services maintaining necessary social distancing through e-Healthcare has become an urgent priority. e-Healthcare services like patient's real-time health monitoring, exchange of electronic health reports, tele-consultation, remote surgery etc. require reliable and timely delivery of data and responses. To provide for such critical requirements it is essential to prioritize the forwarding of different types of data varies based on their throughput requirements and the delay sensitivities. In this paper, we study the network Quality of Service (QoS) control mechanism for e-Health services using the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) approach in a Fog based Healthcare Environment. We distinguish the data generated from various types of devices into priority classes looking at their priorities, throughput and privacy requirements in the application. Hence, we propose, OpenHealthQ, an OpenFlow based traffic shaping model using OpenFlow Queues to handle the healthcare data. OpenHealthQ provides a secure, on-demand and low-cost access to Healthcare 4.0's most demanding computing infrastructure in a distributed cloud architecture with SDN based fog nodes at the network's edge. Experimental studies show that OpenHealthQ is capable of reducing response time of the end host and significant increase in network throughput compared to the Best-Effort (BE) approach.
